# rig_routing_tables: Faster/SpiNNaker implementations of routing table minimisation algorithms

TODO

## Running tests

The C++ code is tested using [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and built using CMake.
Tests can be built and run with:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make run_tests
```

Running the tests will also require that valgrind is installed.
